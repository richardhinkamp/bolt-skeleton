Bolt skeleton
=============

A skeleton for websites using [Bolt][1].

1) Installing
----------------------------------

You install a project based on this Bolt skeleton by using [Composer][2].

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project richardhinkamp/bolt-skeleton path/to/install

Composer will install a project with [Bolt][1] and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.
